<h2>The Under The Innovation Influence Campaign</h2>
<p>Over the past couple of years, The Gambia has been plagued by the twin menace of drug abuse and drug trafficking. This has particularly affected the youths, encouraging a life of crime and addiction. As a result, youths are increasingly unprepared to pursue legitimate career paths, as they often drop out of school. That young people, the Gambia’s greatest resource, are being underexploited thus hindering their chances at full human development is tragic. In light of this issue, the YCP Drug Abuse workshop was launched to facilitate a discussion on educate young people on the adverse effects and train ambassadors in the fight against drug abuse. At the close of the workshop, a declaration was drafted and signed, signifying their commitment to the cause. This declaration, which contained recommendations for   all stakeholders in the community, was sent to several NGOs and the National Drug Enforcement Agency as well as circulated on the worldwide web and national newspapers.  Following the success of this initiative, the participants of this workshop were invited on National TV to educate youths, share past addiction stories and steer young people away from this lifestyle of drugs.</p>

<p>However, much remains to be done. The success of any campaign against drug abuse will depend on how effective rehabilitation efforts are and the availability of youth engagement alternatives. Studies have shown that there is a negative correlation between education and employment, and drug abuse. Studies have also shown that crime and poverty go hand in hand. Therefore, in order to tackle the problems of youth decadence and crime, one must also tackle larger issues of poverty, illiteracy and disillusionment.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that YCP youth ambassadors have decided to step in and be part of the change by doubling their awareness creation efforts in order to reach more members of the society. Being a group of doers, the group seeks to groom other youths to be active members and leaders in their society, seeking knowledge, championing positive change and contributing to development efforts. This initiative – the Under the Innovation Influence campaign — will target all youths especially at-risk youth and known drug abusers. This initiative will operate out of Latrikunda German but will spread out to other cities and communities as the initiative grows. This initiative will serve as both a preventive and a corrective instilling values of leadership and responsibility to all its participants. The initiative will kick off with a writing competition, continue with panel discussions and training  programs and culminate in an entrepreneurship competition.</p>
